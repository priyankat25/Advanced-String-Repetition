Advanced String Repetition:
In an advanced text processing application, you are required to develop a versatile Java program to repeat a given string with additional features. The program should not only repeat the string but also allow users to control the delimiter placed between repeated strings. Write a program that efficiently takes a string, an integer representing the number of repetitions, and a delimiter as input. The program should output the string repeated the specified number of times with the chosen delimiter.

Test Case : 1
Sample input: OpenAI
              5
              ,
Expected output : Repeated string: OpenAI,OpenAI,OpenAI,OpenAI,OpenAI

Test Case : 2
Sample input: Java
              2
              -
Expected output : Repeated string: Java-Java
